First FullStack JavaScript Assignment

Instructions:

            Using Node.js with Express, Mongoose and MongoDB create a user website that is a CRUD application.
            
            It should manage the following data:
            
            User Last Name, First Name, Date of Birth, Address1, Address2, City, Postal Code, Country, Phone-Number, Email and User Notes. 
            
            The data should be collected by a web form and must use the POST HTTP method.
            
            The Web Application should have 3 pages.  One to add data, another to update data and the third to display the data in a table.  Add a delete button on the update page to delete a user.
            
            Use PUG or Handlebars to simplify the webpages.
            
            Use W3CSS  https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/ or BootStrap  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ to format the page and add menus and toolbars.
            
             
            
            Documentation is key and lack of adequate comments will reduce your points.
            Write a set of instructions on how to use your App.
            
            Take a screenshots of your completed app for each of the three pages properly populated and add it to the ZIP file.  If you are using ATLAS please send the login so your app will be verified.
            
            If your files look like they are copied then all involved will be failed.
